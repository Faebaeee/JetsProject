# Jets Project


### Description
This project's focus have been a continuation of object oriented programming with an emphasis on building a parent and child classes and at least 2 interfaces.

For this project, I created an application with a fleet of jets with different capabilities. It needed to have a menu that allowed users to interact with the jets created in an array list and access information about them.

I created three classes that extend from an abstract class, Jet: FighterJet, CargoPlane, and JetImpl. JetImpl is a generic jet which aligns with my Private Jets that I added in my text file, while FighterJet and CargoPlane implement the interfaces CombatReady and CargoCarrier.


### Technologies Used
Git, Eclipse


### Lessons Learned
This project was very tough for me, i got a bit confused when having to keep up with all the classes, interfaces, and methods. Writing down objectives definietly helped a bit.
